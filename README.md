1.1 Components:
ESP8266: A Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller used for data processing and communication.
MQ135 Air Quality Sensor: A sensor capable of detecting a wide range of gases including ammonia, nitrogen oxides, alcohol, benzene, smoke, and carbon dioxide.
IR (Infrared) Sensor: A sensor that detects the presence of objects or motion by using infrared light.

1.2 Functionality:
Air Quality Monitoring: The MQ135 sensor continuously measures the concentration of various gases in the air. It provides an analog output that is read by the ESP8266. The microcontroller processes this data to determine the air quality index or the presence of specific harmful gases.
Object or Motion Detection: The IR sensor detects the presence of objects or motion within its range. This can be used to monitor occupancy in a room or detect movement.

1.3 Applications:
Environmental Monitoring: Can be deployed in various environments to monitor pollution levels.
Security Systems: Using the IR sensor for intrusion detection and integrating with home security systems.
